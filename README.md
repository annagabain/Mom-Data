# Mom Data
## Budget Analysing Tool for the Whole Family
Mom Data is a user-freindly application for storing, retrieveing and calculating major life expense categories: Food, Transport, Accomodation and Clothing.
The application populates a database from user input, calculates the sum of the monthly expenses and compares it to the given budget.

This project is an application developed in Python, that runs in a command-line and is visually presented through the Heroku platform.
